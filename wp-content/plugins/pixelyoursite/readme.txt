Insert the new Facebook Pixel on WordPress, add Standard Events, enjoy superb WooCommerce Facebook Pixel integration

== Description ==
<strong>Manage the New Facebook Pixel With Just a Few Clicks</strong></br>

As you probably know, Facebook will retire the old Facebook Conversion Pixel in 2016. They recommend us to use the New Facebook Pixel for conversion tracking, optimization and remarketing.

**PixelYourSite will help you insert the pixel code on every page with just one click** and set up Custom or Standard Events on any page or post. There is an **out of the box WooCommerce setup** that will configure all the necessary standard events for you.  

**Facebook Dynamic Ads are fully supported on WooCommerce**, with ViewContent, AddToCart and Purchase events being added on the corresponding pages (content_ids and content_type are pulled automatically by the plugin).

The plugin is **Custom Audience super-friendly**, extracting content_name, content_type, content_ids on every page of your site. We also have a guide that you can download for free on how to handle this option and how to build Custom Audiences.

There is a **[Learning Section](http://www.pixelyoursite.com/learn)** on our website, with helpful articles that answer to our users common (and sometimes uncommon) questions, together with top notch “how to”pages.

<strong>What's next<strong>

We are working on some new handy features for the plugin and we will release them soon.

<strong>Pixel Helper False Errors</strong>

If you are testing your pixel with Pixel Helper Chrome Extension, it is possible that you will see some **false** errors:

**Event ID: AddToCart**: Facebook Pixel did not load.

You can safely ignore it. It is a normal error trigger by the dynamic AddToCart event that will disappear after you click on the add to cart button.  


**Event ID: GeneralEvent**: Content_type is missing, should be either 'product' or 'product_group'

You can safely ignore it. It’s a Dynamic Ads warning, but this event is not meant to be used for Dynamic Ads. It is completely dedicated to Custom Audiences and works perfectly. If you are using WooCommerce, there is a ViewContent event fully ready for the Dynamic Ads job.
