<strong>What's next<strong>

We are working on some new handy features for the plugin and we will release them soon.

<strong>Pixel Helper Errors</strong>

If you are testing your pixel with Pixel Helper Chrome Extension, it is possible that you will see some errors:

**Facebook Pixel can't match products**

It means that the product ID is not found in a Dynamic Ads Product Catalog. If you are not doing Dynamic Ads, or if that event is not Dynamic Ads related, then you are fine. Otherwise, check your product catalog feed and make sure that that id is present in there.
