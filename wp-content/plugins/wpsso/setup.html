<p>WPSSO works great "<em>right out of the box</em>" &mdash; and you could keep
the default plugin settings as-is &mdash; but taking a few minutes to review
some basic options can help maximize your social presence and click-through
rate. ;-)</p>

<dl>

<dt><h3>Website Social Accounts</h3></dt>

<dd><p>If you haven't already done so, create a Facebook Page, Twitter account, and
Google+ account (or Page) for your website / business. You can enter your
website's social account information on the WordPress <u>Settings &gt; Website
Social Pages and Accounts</u> page. The social account values are used by WPSSO
for Google / SEO, Schema, Open Graph, and other meta tag values &mdash;
including the publisher / Organization social profile URLs in the Schema
JSON-LD markup (which may appear in Google Search results to highlight your
website / business social pages).<p>
</dd>

<dt><h3>Author Social Accounts</h3></dt>

<dd><p>Ask your authors to enter their Facebook, Google+, and Twitter contact
information on their WordPress user profile page. Each author's contact
information can appear in various meta tag values and Schema JSON-LD markup
&mdash; but only if they complete their user profile. All URLs found in the
author's contact methods will be listed in the author  / Person social profile
markup for Google.</p>

<p>Authors should take a moment to update their <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=followers">Facebook Follower
Settings</a> to enable a <em>Follow</em> button on Facebook. In this way,
authors can publish both private (for friends) and public (for friends and
followers) content on their Facebook wall. When an author allows followers,
Facebook will also link an author's name in shares to their profile page.</p>
</dd>

<dt><h3>Essential Settings</h3></dt>

<dd><p>Review the site description on the SSO <u>Essential Settings</u> page and
select a default / fallback image ID or URL. The default image is used for
index / archive pages, and as a fallback for Posts and Pages that do not have a
suitable image featured, attached, or in their content. See the SSO <u>General
Settings &gt; Images</u> tab for these and other image related options.</p>
</dd>

<dt><h3>Image Dimensions</h3></dt>

<dd><p>Review the WordPress <u>Settings &gt; Social and SEO Image Dimensions</u>
values. If your original images are large enough, you should set the Open Graph
image dimensions to 1200x630px cropped or larger. Images that are 600px and
wider are displayed more prominently on Facebook, and 1200px or better is
required to avoid upscaling (stretching) images for retina / high-PPI displays
&mdash; so it's worth taking the time to make sure <em>all</em> your original
images are at least 1200px wide, along with setting an Open Graph image
dimension of 1200x630px cropped.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cropped or Uncropped?</h4>
<p>The difference between cropped and uncropped image dimensions is important
to know &mdash; when resizing <em>and</em> cropping an image, it will be
resized so that <em>both</em> sides meet or exceed the image dimensions
required and <u>the excess width or height is trimmed</u>. The resulting image
will match the required dimensions <em>exactly</em> (having sacrificed parts of
the image). When resizing without cropping, <u>the original aspect ratio is
preserved</u>, and no parts of the image are sacrificed. The image will be
resized so both the width and height fit <em>within</em> the designed size
&mash; so only one side of the image will match the required size.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Upscale / Enlarge Images?</h4>
<p>WordPress does not upscale (enlarge) images &mdash; WordPress only creates
smaller images from larger full-size originals. Upscaled images do not look as
sharp or clean when upscaled, and if enlarged too much, images will look fuzzy
and unappealing &mdash; not something you want to promote on social sites.
WPSSO Pro includes an optional module that allows upscaling of WordPress Media
Library images for WPSSO image sizes (up to a maximum upscale percentage). For
example, a full-size image of 100x200px could be upscaled up to 150x300px using
the default maximum of 50%, but resizing the images any larger would fail
(unless you increased the maximum).</p> 

<p>If you feel strongly that upscaling small images in your WordPress Media
Library is something you want (instead of uploading larger full-size
originals), you can enable this feature under the <u>Advanced &gt; WP / Theme
Integration</u> tab. <em>Do not enable this feature unless you want to publish
lower quality images on social sites.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Verify Image Dimensions?</h4>
<p>WPSSO Pro can double-check that all images returned by WordPress match the
dimensions it requested (as WordPress can return smaller and/or inaccurate
images). This check also insures that images which are too small and/or tall /
wide for social sites are rejected in favour of other larger (and more
suitable) images. You can enforce this image check by enabling the "Enforce
Image Dimensions Check" option under the <u>Advanced &gt; WP / Theme
Integration</u> tab.</p>
</blockquote>

<dt><h3>Validation Tools</h3></dt>

<dd><p>Submit a few sample Posts, Pages, etc. to the <a
href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/">Facebook
Debugger</a></strong> to verify your Open Graph meta tags. A link to the
Facebook Debugger is available under the Validate tab in the <u>Social
Settings</u> metabox (on post, taxonomy, and user editing pages). Submitting a
URL to the Facebook Debugger can also be used to clear Facebook's cache (after
clicking the "Fetch new scrape information" button a few times). If you're
validating older posts / pages, pre-dating the activation of WPSSO, <a
href="http://wpsso.com/codex/plugins/wpsso/faq/why-does-facebook-show-the-wrong-image-text/">Facebook
may continue to use the old meta tag values from its cache</a> even after
fetching the new scrape information.</p>

<p>Submit a Post / Page to the <a
href="http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/">Pinterest Rich Pin
Validator</a> and request approval for Rich Pins. Pinterest Rich Pins are an
extension of Open Graph (and Schema) meta tags, but the Rich Pin Validator can
be a little buggy, so double check any errors with the Facebook Debugger to
make sure they are actual / real errors.</p>

<p>Submit index / archive and Post / Page URLs to the <A
href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> to verify
the HTML of your theme templates. Social crawlers expect properly coded HTML
markup that conforms to current HTML / XHTML standards. If your webpages
contain serious markup errors, social and/or search engine crawlers may be
unable to parse your webpage content. Fix and/or report any template markup
issues with your theme author.</p>
</dd>

<dt><h3>Interface and General Usage</h3></dt>

<dd><p>On most WordPress admin pages you'll find a <em>Screen Options</em>
drop-down tab on the upper right-hand side of the page. You can use these
options to include/exclude certain WPSSO metaboxes and columns from the current
page. For example, when viewing the Posts or Pages list you can use the
<em>Screen Options</em> drop-down tab to hide / view the "Social Img" and
"Social Desc" columns. You can also enable / disable these columns globally
under the Advanced &gt; Social Settings tab.</p>

<p>When editing a Post, Page, category, tag, etc., you'll find a <u>Social
Settings</u> metabox at the bottom of the page, where you can edit various
social texts and image values. The "Preview" tab shows how this webpage might
look like when shared on Facebook, the "Head Tags" tab shows a complete listing
of meta tags created by WPSSO, including additional Schema markup and LD+JSON
for Google, and the "Validate" tab allows you to submit the current webpage URL
to a number of test and validation tools.</p>
</dd>

<dt><h3>Caching Plugins and Services</h3></dt>

<dd><p>WPSSO allows you to customize a few Open Graph meta tag and Schema markup
values specifically for the Pinterest crawler. If you use a caching plugin (or
front-end caching service), it should detect the Pinterest user-agent and
bypass its cache (for example, look for a "User-Agent Exclusion Pattern"
setting and add "Pinterest/" to that list). In order to provide the most
up-to-date information for social and search crawlers, you may also consider
adding the following user-agents to your caching plugin / service exclusion
list:</p>

<pre>
facebookexternalhit/
Pinterest/
Twitterbot/
W3C_Validator/
</pre>

<dt><h3>Documentation and Resources</h3></dt>

<dd><p>WPSSO is a powerful tool and social framework that detects images and videos
from a variety of sources (attached, featured, content, etc.), along with 3rd
party plugins and e-commerce product information. It's worth noting some of the
most common questions, to get an idea of what WPSSO can do, and some of the
issues that may come up. Some of the most relevant / popular frequently asked
questions are:</p>

<dt><h3>Developers and Designers</h3></dt>

<dd><p>Website developers / designers will probably want to consider a few additional settings...</p>
<ol>
	<!-- Apply WordPress Content Filters -->
	<li>If your site uses shortcodes, you'll want to enable the "Apply
	WordPress Content Filters" option to expand shortcodes in the content
	for description text and/or image meta tags (the content can be
	searched for images).</li>

	<!-- WPSSO_HIDE_ALL_WARNINGS -->
	<li>WPSSO can display warning notices if images are too small for the
	dimensions required. If you are using WordPress v4.2 or better, these
	notices can be dismissed individually. You can also define the
	<code>WPSSO_HIDE_ALL_WARNINGS</code> constant as true to auto-hide all
	dismissable warnings.</li>

	<!-- Show Social Img / Desc Columns -->
	<li>Users can hide / unhide the "Social Img" and "Social Desc" columns
	using the <em>Screen Options</em> drop-down tab, but you can also
	enable / disable these columns globally under the Advanced settings
	&gt; Social Settings tab.</li>

	<!-- Custom Field Names -->
	<li>If your theme uses custom fields to manage additional image and
	video URLs (and embed video HTML), you can enter those custom field
	names (aka post meta names) under the Advanced settings &gt; Social
	Settings tab.</li>

	<!-- Check for Duplicate Meta Tags -->
	<li>If you know that your theme header templates do not include any
	social meta tags, and no other plugin is adding social meta tags to
	your webpages, then you could disable the "Check for Duplicate Meta
	Tags" option.</li>

	<!-- head Attributes Filter Hook -->
	<li>WPSSO modifies the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element attributes to
	add a Schema item type for the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section only.
	To have WPSSO add the Schema item type for the whole page instead,
	change the "&lt;head&gt; Attributes Filter Hook" value from
	'head_attributes' to 'language_attributes'.</li>

	<!-- WPSSO Schema JSON-LD -->
	<li>WPSSO creates a few Schema <em>meta tags</em> (name, description,
	and image) for Google+, along with the WebSite, Organization, and
	Person social JSON-LD markup (on the home page) for Google Search. If
	your theme does not include proper Schema markup for your content
	(author, images, videos, etc.), you should consider enabling the <a
	href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/"
	target="_blank">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD</a> extension, which adds complete
	Schema JSON-LD markup (BlogPosting, Article, Place, Product, etc.) to
	webpages for Google and Pinterest. </li>

	<!-- WPSSO_IMAGE_UPSCALE_TEST -->
	<li>You can <em>simulate / test</em> the WPSSO image upscaling feature,
	to generate all the necessary success / failure notice messages,
	without having WordPress actually save the resulting images &mdash;
	define the <code>WPSSO_IMAGE_UPSCALE_TEST</code> constant as true, or
	hook the 'wpsso_image_upscale_test' filter and return true. Other
	constants and filters are also available to upscale all images (not
	just the WPSSO image sizes) and adjust the maximum percentage.</li>
