**A solid social meta tag plugin is the foundation of any good social strategy** &mdash; WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) gives you total control over all the information social website crawlers need, improving *Google Search ranking*, *social engagement*, and *click-through-rates* on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and many more &mdash; independently of any social sharing buttons you may or may not already use (sharing buttons are not required).

**Optional Free and Pro extensions** &mdash; [WPSSO Mobile App Meta](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-am/) for Apple Store / iTunes and Google Play App meta tags, [WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-plm/) for Pinterest Place, Facebook / Open Graph Location, Schema Local Business + Local SEO meta tags, [WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) for Google and Pinterest Schema.org markup (BlogPosting, Article, Place, Product, etc.), [WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/), and others.

<blockquote id="changelog_top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
