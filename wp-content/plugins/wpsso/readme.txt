<p><img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;height:auto;float:left;margin:10px 60px 40px 0;" />
<strong>A solid social markup plugin is the foundation of any good social strategy</strong> &mdash; WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) allows you to manage the information social websites need, improving <em>Google Search ranking</em>, <em>social engagement</em>, and <em>click-through-rates</em> on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and many more.</p>

<p><strong>Complete <a href="http://ogp.me/">Facebook / Open Graph</a>, <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/rich-pins">Pinterest Rich Pin</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Card</a>, SEO meta tags and <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema</a> markup</strong> &mdash; meta tags and Schema markup are read by Google Search and <em>all</em> social websites, to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, ecommerce product details, author profile / authorship, publisher name, etc.). WPSSO uses the existing content of your webpages to generate complete meta tags and Schema markup &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings.</p>

<p><strong>Easy and comprehensive social meta tags and Schema markup</strong> &mdash; WPSSO (Pro version) <em>automatically</em> retrieves and uses information from a wide range or sources, including All in One SEO Pack, bbPress, BuddyPress, Co-Authors Plus, Easy Digital Downloads, HeadSpace2 SEO, NextGEN Gallery, MarketPress - WordPress eCommerce, Polylang, rtMedia for WordPress (BuddyPress and bbPress), The Events Calendar, The SEO Framework, WooCommerce, WP e-Commerce, WordPress REST API, Yoast SEO (aka WordPress SEO), Yotpo Social Reviews for WooCommerce, along with service APIs like Bitly, Google URL Shortener, Gravatar, Ow.ly, Slideshare, TinyURL, Vimeo, Wistia, Your Own URL Shortener (YOURLS), and YouTube.</p>

<blockquote id="changelog_top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
