== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a bot? =
[wptele.ga/?p=101](https://wptele.ga/?p=101)

= How can i let users subscribe? =
[wptele.ga/?p=440](https://wptele.ga/?p=440)

= What is Zapier and how do i integrate it? =
[wptele.ga/?p=442](https://wptele.ga/?p=442)

= How to set up dynamic replies? =
The best way to integrate and add functions is to create another plugin.
For example, create a file called **telegram-bot-custom.php** and upload it to wp-content/plugins, then activate it.
Write the file as follows:

`<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Telegram Bot & Channel (Custom)
Description: My Custom Telegram Plugin
Author: My name
Version: 1
*/

add_action('telegram_parse','telegramcustom_parse', 10, 2);

function telegramcustom_parse( $telegram_user_id, $text ) {
    $plugin_post_id = telegram_getid( $telegram_user_id );

    if ( !$plugin_post_id ) {
        return;
    }

	/*
	Here is the dynamic processing and how to reply.
	You can:
	- use if, switch and everything that works in php
	- check if $text is made of multiple words (create an array from $text)
	- customize and code other actions (ex. create WordPress post is $telegram_user_id is your id)
	*/

    if ( $text == '/command') {
        telegram_sendmessage( $telegram_user_id, 'Oh, yes you typed /command');
    }

    return;
}

?>`

= How to set up dynamic keyboards? =
You can start from the previous plugin created, and add the following filter:

`add_filter( 'telegram_get_reply_markup_filter', 'telegram_get_reply_markup_filter_custom', 1 );

function telegram_get_reply_markup_filter_custom( $id ) {
    if ( $id ) {
        switch ( $id ) {
            case 7: //Your command ID (found in the url while editing the command)
                telegram_log('####', $id, 'custom keyboard'); //Useful for debug
                return array(
                    'keyboard' => array(array('Top Left', 'Top Right'),array('Bottom')),
                    'resize_keyboard' => true, //true or false (suggested: true)
                    'one_time_keyboard' => true //true or false
                    );            
            default:
                return;
        }
    }
}`
