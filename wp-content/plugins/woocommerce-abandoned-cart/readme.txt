This easy-to-use plugin allows WooCommerce store owners to recover sales that are lost to abandoned shopping carts by customers. 

== Description ==

Abandoned Cart plugin works in the background, sending email notifications to your guests customers & logged-in customers, reminding them about their abandoned orders.

The Abandoned Cart plugin allows you to recover orders that were just a step away from closing. It enables you to create automatic & well-timed email reminders to be sent to your customers who have added your products to their cart, but did not complete the order. As a result, with this plugin you will start recovering at least 30% or more of your lost sales. Why let this 30% revenue go unclaimed?

**Pro Version:**

**[Abandoned Cart Pro for WooCommerce 3.3](http://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/woocommerce-abandoned-cart-pro "Abandoned Cart Pro for WooCommerce")** - The PRO version allows you to track products in abandoned carts, create unlimited email templates, track coupons, keep a track of sent emails & much more.


**Email Sending Setup:**

From version 1.3, it is not mandatory to set a cron job via CPanel for the abandoned cart email notifications to be sent. We are now using WP-Cron that sends the emails automatically whenever a page is requested.

Abandoned Cart Plugin relies on a function called WP-Cron, and this function only runs when there is a page requested. So, if there are no visits to your website, then the scheduled jobs are not run. Generally this method of sending the abandoned cart notification emails is reliable. However, if you are not very confident about the traffic volume of your website, then you can set a manual cron job via Cpanel or any other control panel that your host provides. 

== Installation ==

1. Ensure you have latest version of WooCommerce plugin installed
2. Unzip and upload contents of the plugin to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. The plugin will start working as per the settings entered.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the plugin track carts abandoned by guest users? =

Currently there is no provision for tracking guest carts. This is planned in a future release.

UPDATE: This feature has been released in version 2.2.

= Why are abandoned cart notification emails not getting sent? =

Please ensure you have followed the instructions in "Email Sending Setup" right above this FAQ. Additionally, if you have the PRO version, please verify that you have selected "Enable abandoned cart notifications" option in Settings. With this option turned off, the abandoned carts are recorded, but emails are not sent.

= Where can I find the documentation on how to setup the plugin? =

The documentation can be found **[here](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/woocommerce-abandon-cart-plugin-documentation/ "WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro")**. The Lite version is a subset of the Pro version, so the same documentation can be used to refer for the Lite version of the plugin.

== Changelog ==

* New Feature - New merge tag {{cart.unsubscribe}} has been added for email templates. This merge tag allows user to stop receiving further abandoned cart reminder email notifications. This merge tag has been added to comply with email sending laws in different countries.

* Bugs Fixed - Earlier if any user came from abandoned cart reminder email and place the order using PayPal payment gateway and do not reach the order received page. Then plugin was not considering that order as a recovered order. From now onwards if the user came from the abandoned cart reminder email and place the order using PayPal and does not reach the order received the page. Then plugin will consider that cart as a recovered order.

* Bugs Fixed - When the cart is abandoned as a guest & product have the special character in the attributes name, then it was displaying a blank row with only a checkbox on the Abandoned Orders tab. This has been fixed.

= 2.8 =

* We have changed the encryption for the links that are sent in the Abandoned cart email notifications. Earlier we were using the mcrypt library for encoding the data. If mcrypt library was not installed on the server, then abandoned cart email notifications were not sent. Now we have used different functions for encoding the string. We have used microtime function & a security key. Using this security key, and after applying an algorithm on it, we generate the encoded string.

* The session now starts only on required pages of the store. Earlier it was started globally. This will help to improve the site performance.

* Earlier if email body was blank and we send the test email then blank email was sent. This has been fixed. Now if email body is blank then test email will not be sent.

* Tweak - Earlier when {{products.cart}} merge tag is used in abandoned cart email template, then on click of the product name and product image, it was redirecting to the product page. Now it will redirect the user to the cart page.
